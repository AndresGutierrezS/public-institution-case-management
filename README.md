# Public Institution Minor Case Management System

## Overview

**Public Institution Minor Case Management System** is a full-stack web application developed as a recreation of an original system built during professional internships.

**Full description:**  
_A Public Institution Minor Case Management System focused on information management, monitoring, and protection of minors._

The system is designed to manage institutional case information related to minors under public care or supervision, including personal data, legal follow-ups, protective measures, and case status tracking.

To avoid legal or ethical issues, **all data, names, logos, institutions, and entities used in this project are completely fictional**.  
This repository is intended strictly for **educational, demonstrative, and portfolio purposes**.

## Project Structure

The system is divided into two main parts:

* **Frontend**: Built with **React + TypeScript**, responsible for the user interface and client-side logic.
* **Backend**: Built with **Laravel**, responsible for business logic, API endpoints, and data handling. The backend is fully containerized using **Docker (Laravel Sail)**.
